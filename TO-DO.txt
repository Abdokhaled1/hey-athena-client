TASK LIST:
- Give Athena emotions (scan input and evaluate to match emotion & bases it off of current emotion, then adjust's athena's emotion accordingly if being sympathetic?)
- Give Athena: fundamental laws & conversation context (smart matching)
- Cache queries/mp3 responses
- Create a response probability matrix with cached query/response patterns
- Consider making a smart module guesser based on a probability/threshold
	- Save all queries w/ corresponding module and test if new text is a close match
	- Factors: saved text match strength, relative # mod calls, mod priority
	- Add ability to reselect mod if guess was incorrect
- Design passive modules to run in background/on events (cronjob scheduler?)
- Implement data/debug logging (look into using python's logging library)
- Advertise ATHENA once released (perhaps on reddit/kickstarter and tech blogs like engadget)

MODULE IDEAS:
- Oauth API
- Gmail (and other google modules)
- Calender (regular)
- Twitter
- Facebook
- Phone Texting (for multiple carriers)
- Text-based Games (zork, etc.)
- Movement (passive, active, API)
