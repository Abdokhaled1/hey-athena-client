Get pumped up on Athena and start making flyers for a meeting (also research sponsors on Inc/Business Insider)

WAYS TO MONETIZE:
- Donators
- Angel Investors
- Advertisements (used sparingly and only when effective)
- Buying/selling premium modules
- Hosting servers for cloud computing (rent them)
- Parent company adopts us and funds us

BARRIERS:
- Compile/export/support multiple platforms
- Configuring microphones/speakers for all platforms (PyAudio)
- Making sure dependencies stay up to date and work (PyAudio, SpeechRecognition, gTTS, etc.)
- Get accurate wake-up-word detection (and ensure minimal false triggers)
- Ensure active listening stops when you finish talking
- Acquire developers
- Steal Jasper community
- Build a simple website that lets people contribute to the client and add modules
- Create simple documentation for all platforms

POSSIBLE NAME IDEAS:

TASK LIST:
- Figure out a way to be different from Amazon Alexa
- Make this product dead simple to install and upgrade
- Get designers to design a website
- Create bleeding edge vs. release build
- Make weather module speak
- Create test files
- Consider making an Athena Light, Athena Full, and Athena Distributed
- Refine the pitch
- Build a community
    - Create a presentation video explaining our vision
    - Create a better website that allows users to contribute easily
    - Build a modules section that allows users to submit/browse for modules
- Give Athena emotions (scan input and evaluate to match emotion & bases it off of current emotion, then adjust's athena's emotion accordingly if being sympathetic?)
- Give Athena: fundamental laws & conversation context (smart matching)
- Cache queries/mp3 responses
- Create a response probability matrix with cached query/response patterns
- Consider making a smart module guesser based on a probability/threshold
	- Save all queries w/ corresponding module and test if new text is a close match
	- Factors: saved text match strength, relative # mod calls, mod priority
	- Add ability to reselect mod if guess was incorrect
- Design passive modules to run in background/on events (cronjob scheduler?)
- Implement data/debug logging (look into using python's logging library)
- Advertise ATHENA once released (perhaps on reddit/kickstarter and tech blogs like engadget)

MODULE IDEAS:
- Consider making modules that you stay in until you type quit (e.g. zork or extensive conversation)
- Oauth API
- Canvas
- Gmail (and other google modules)
- Calender (regular)
- Twitter (automate sending tweets)
- Facebook
- Phone Texting (for multiple carriers)
- Text-based Games (zork, etc.)
- Movement (passive, active, API)
