Get pumped up on Athena and start making flyers for a meeting (also research sponsors on Inc/Business Insider)

PITCH (raw/unfiltered):
Every developer, in an abstract sense, has the underlying goal to turn his/her computer into an assistant of some sort.
In the past, people would program computers to process some text-based input and output a result.
There is a thrill for developers, that first time you make it say "hello world".
There is a thrill in saying, "Hey, I made the computer do that!"
However, within the past decade, we've been moving away from text-based systems and advancing toward voice-based systems.
Now, programs like Siri, and Cortana are turning "hello world" into human-like response of "hello world" (answering millions of questions every day).
Finding out who won the 1973 SuperBowl is as simple as asking your phone that question.
Despite the advanced capabilities of these programs, there are always more things that you wish it could do.
There are always better responses that you wish it had.
Enter Athena Voice.
Athena Voice is a 100% open-source, voice-controlled assistant platform that allows users to process user input the way they decide.
It is written uniformly in Python 3 and is very easy to understand.
Adding modules to enhance Athena's functionality is as simple as browsing, downloading, and dragging and dropping the python module file into the module directory.
In the near future, this system can be implemented in your car or home by simply having a microphone, speaker, and processing unit.
With Athena Voice, smart homes will become ubiquitous.
A simple device with a microphone, speaker, and transmitter can be placed in each room to answer your questions wherever you go.

POSSIBLE NAME IDEAS:

Clovis
Icarus

TASK LIST:
- Create bleeding edge vs. release build
- Make weather module speak
- Create test files
- Consider making an Athena Light and Athena Full
- Refine the pitch
- Build a community
    - Create a presentation video explaining our vision
    - Create a better website that allows users to contribute easily
    - Build a modules section that allows users to submit/browse for modules
- Give Athena emotions (scan input and evaluate to match emotion & bases it off of current emotion, then adjust's athena's emotion accordingly if being sympathetic?)
- Give Athena: fundamental laws & conversation context (smart matching)
- Cache queries/mp3 responses
- Create a response probability matrix with cached query/response patterns
- Consider making a smart module guesser based on a probability/threshold
	- Save all queries w/ corresponding module and test if new text is a close match
	- Factors: saved text match strength, relative # mod calls, mod priority
	- Add ability to reselect mod if guess was incorrect
- Design passive modules to run in background/on events (cronjob scheduler?)
- Implement data/debug logging (look into using python's logging library)
- Advertise ATHENA once released (perhaps on reddit/kickstarter and tech blogs like engadget)

MODULE IDEAS:
- Oauth API
- Canvas
- Gmail (and other google modules)
- Calender (regular)
- Twitter (automate sending tweets)
- Facebook
- Phone Texting (for multiple carriers)
- Text-based Games (zork, etc.)
- Movement (passive, active, API)
